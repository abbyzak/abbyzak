Over the years, I've spearheaded research & development across diverse areas such as LLMs, Deep Learning, and
Data Scraping. I have hands-on experience with tools and technologies like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Puppeteer,
Asyncio, aiohttp, Apache Kafka, Pytorch, and more. My proficiency in these areas aligns seamlessly with the
requirements of this role.

Moreover, I have extensive experience in advanced embedded systems and Real-Time Operating Systems
(RTOS). I have worked with cutting-edge technologies such as ARM Cortex-M series microcontrollers, FreeRTOS,
and Zephyr RTOS for developing high-performance embedded systems. My projects involved implementing
complex algorithms for sensor data fusion, real-time control, and communication protocols like SPI, I2C, and
UART. I also have expertise in hardware design, PCB layout, and debugging, ensuring the robustness and
reliability of embedded solutions.
